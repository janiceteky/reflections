It is always a better security practice to keep a repository remotely and it allows one to be able to access the data from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I allow Git to automatically stay up-to-date, Git may pull changes while you are in the middle of making a change which would probably cause errors.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A fork makes a copy of a github repository and puts it in my repository, the copies are independent of each other.  A clone copies a repository from github to my local repository.  A branch is a seperate of a repository.
