What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?  How would branches help?

A branch might be useful if I realize a logical change within the current branch.  I would help me by seperating the code.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams help visualize the branch structure by laying them out in sequential order so that I know where I am in the tree.


What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result of merging two branches is that everything is accessible from the master branch that way changes will not be lost.
